# Hey there!

# NOTE: Disabled due to subdirectories not working correctly!

# Nice that you're reading this file, but this is going to be a little more complicated than usual.
# gcc (and therefore compile.sh) outputs binary files without extensions, which are not wanted on
# this Github repo. Therefore we need to start by ignoring everything
#*

# but we want _some_ files on the repo. So we unignore all files with extensions.
#!*.*

# Now it'd be nice to have our directories also exluded, but this should not include files without
# extensions in subdirectories.
#!*/*.*

# Lastly we do not want our intermediate .o files to be pushed.
